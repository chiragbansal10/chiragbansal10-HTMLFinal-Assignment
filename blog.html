   <h1>50 Exercises for a Bodyweight Workout You Can Do Anywhere</h1> 
   <p>Who needs a gym when there’s the living room floor?</p>
   <p>Bodyweight exercises are simple, effective ways to improve balance, flexibility, and strength without gym machines or equipment. You can do all these bodyweight exercises at home.</p>
   <p>From legs and shoulders to chest and abs, we’ve covered every part of your body that can get stronger with body resistance alone.</p>
   <p>We’ve also provided some basic bodyweight exercises for beginners and compared bodyweight workout results to those of weighted, gym, and cardio routines.</p>
   <h1>Lift yourself: What is a bodyweight workout?</h1>
   <p>Bodyweight workouts are exercise routines that use a person’s own bodyweight to create resistance and improve strength, flexibility, and endurance, as well as coordination.</p>
<p>You’ve probably done a push-up before — well done. You’ve already met bodyweight exercises. On occasion, you can use a wand or resistance band to support an exercise.</p>
<p>While there are bodyweight exercises you can do in a gym (pull-ups, anyone?), having a calisthenics or plyometrics routine means you can stay in shape without the need for a gym membership or expensive equipment.</p>
